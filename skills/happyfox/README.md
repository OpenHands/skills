## Triggers

This skill is activated by the following keywords:

- `happyfox`

## Details

The skill supports two environment variable prefixes. Use whichever matches your configuration:

### Option 1: HFOX Prefix (supports custom domains)
- `HFOX_API_KEY`: Your HappyFox API key
- `HFOX_AUTH_CODE`: Your HappyFox auth code
- `HFOX_BASE_URL`: Full base URL (e.g., `https://support.example.com` or `https://acme.happyfox.com`)

### Option 2: HAPPYFOX Prefix (standard HappyFox domains)
- `HAPPYFOX_API_KEY`: Your HappyFox API key
- `HAPPYFOX_AUTH_CODE`: Your HappyFox auth code
- `HAPPYFOX_SUBDOMAIN`: Your HappyFox subdomain (e.g., `acme` for `acme.happyfox.com`)

<IMPORTANT>
You can use `curl` with basic authentication to interact with HappyFox's REST API.
ALWAYS use the HappyFox API for operations instead of a web browser.
Before performing any HappyFox operations, run the credential detection script to set up the unified `$HF_*` variables.

### Authentication

HappyFox uses HTTP Basic Authentication where:

- Password = Auth Code

### Ticket Identifiers

- **Ticket Number**: The numeric ID used in API endpoints (e.g., `3`)
- **Display ID**: Human-readable ID shown in the UI (e.g., `#DC00000003`)

### Status Behaviors

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `pending` | Ticket is open and active |
| `completed` | Ticket is closed/resolved |

### Custom Field Format

Custom fields use a specific format in API payloads:
- Ticket custom fields: `t-cf-<ID>`
- Contact custom fields: `c-cf-<ID>`
